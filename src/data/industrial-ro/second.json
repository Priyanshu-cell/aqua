  "image": "/industrial-ro/img-2.png",
  "specifications": {
    "flowRate": "500 liters per hour",
    "recoveryRate": "Typically around 50-75%, meaning it can recover 50-75% of the input water as pure water.",
    "membrane": "High-quality RO membranes designed to remove up to 99% of dissolved solids.",
    "pump": "High-pressure pump to force water through the RO membrane.",
    "preFilters": [
      "Sediment Filter: Removes larger particles like sand, silt, and dirt.",
      "Carbon Filter: Removes chlorine and organic impurities."
    ],
    "postFilters": "Additional filtration stages after the RO membrane for polishing the water.",
    "frame": "Stainless steel frame for durability and corrosion resistance.",
    "controlPanel": "User-friendly control panel with pressure gauges, flow meters, and control switches.",
    "electricalRequirements": "Typically 220V/50Hz or as per region-specific requirements.",
    "dimensions": "Varies by manufacturer, but usually compact enough to fit in a small industrial space.",
    "automaticShutOff": "System shuts down when the storage tank is full."
  },
  "benefits": [
    "High Purity Water: Removes up to 99% of contaminants including dissolved salts, bacteria, and viruses.",
